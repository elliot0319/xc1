## Overview
This project is a work in progress, and was originally developed for research vehicle platforms at the University of Maryland Alfred Gessow Rotorcraft Center. Current Version: Beta 1.2.

dRehmFlight is a simple, bare-bones flight controller intended for all types of vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) vehicles from simple multirotors to more complex transitioning vehicles. This flight controller software and hardware package was developed with people in mind who may not be particularly fluent in object-oriented programming. The goal is to have an easy to understand flow of discrete operations that allows anyone with basic knowledge of coding in C/Arduino to peer into the code, make the changes they need for their specific application, and quickly have something flying. It is assumed that anyone using this code has previous experience building and flying model aircraft and is familiar with basic RC technology and terminology. The Teensy 4.0 board used for dRehmFlight is an extremely powerful microcontroller that allows for understandable code to run at very high speeds: perfect for a hobby-level flight controller. 

Rather than a comprehensive package suitable for plug-and-play type setup, this package serves more as a toolkit, where all the required difficult computations and processes are done for you. From there, it is simple to adapt to your specific vehicle configuration with full access to every variable and pinout, unlike other flight controller packages. The code is easily modified and expandable to include your own actuators, data collection methods, and sensors. Much more information is provided in the comprehensive dRehmFlight VTOL Documentation .pdf.

This code is entirely free to use and will stay that way forever. If you found this helpful for your project, donations are appreciated: [Paypal Donation](https://www.paypal.me/NicholasRehm)



### Hardware Requirements
This flight controller is based off of the Teensy 4.0 microcontroller and MPU6050 6DOF IMU. The following components (available on Amazon) are required to complete the flight controller assembly:


**Teensy 4.0**: https://amzn.to/2V1q2Gw

**GY-521 MPU6050 IMU**: https://amzn.to/3edF1Vn

These (and all Amazon links contained within the supporting documentation) are Amazon Affiliate links; by purchasing from these, I receive a small portion of the revenue at no cost to you. I appreciate any and all support!

### Software Requirments
Code is uploaded to the board using the Arduino IDE; download the latest version here: https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software

To connect to the Teensy, you must also download and install the Teensyduino arduino add-on; download and instructions available here: https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_download.html
